# The `Framework Fatigue` Project

There's a new JS framework coming out everyday, and all of them are the next greatest thing ever.

This is my attempt to organize the chaos and gather my learnings in a structured way.

## Structure

- Each package is it's own experiment
- I try to implement a simple app in each
  - just fetching some users from Github and showing charts for their repos
- I might not implement every feature in every framework, I'm just trying to get a feel for them
- Mostly the focus is on state management & side-effects so that would be where I'd start
